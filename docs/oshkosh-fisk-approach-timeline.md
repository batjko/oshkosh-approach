## Important Cautions and Common Pitfalls

When flying the Oshkosh Fisk Approach, be aware of these critical points to avoid misunderstandings and ensure safe operations:

1. **NORDO Procedures**: Be prepared for NORDO (no radio) operations. If your radio fails, continue the approach and watch for light gun signals.
   - ATC often says: "If you lose radio contact, continue the approach and watch the tower for light gun signals."

2. **Aircraft Identification**: ATC identifies aircraft by type and color, not by N-number. Be sure you know how your aircraft will be described.
   - ATC might say: "Blue and white high-wing, rock your wings." Make sure you respond if this describes your aircraft.

3. **Wing Rock Acknowledgment**: When instructed to rock your wings, make it a noticeable movement. A timid wing rock might not be seen.
   - ATC often reminds: "Make your wing rocks visible. We need to see them clearly."

4. **Speed Management**: Maintain the prescribed speed (90 knots or 2,300 RPM for slower aircraft) precisely. Falling behind or getting ahead disrupts the entire flow.
   - Listen for: "You're falling behind/getting too close. Adjust your speed immediately."

5. **Runway Assignment**: Your runway assignment may change at the last minute due to traffic flow. Be prepared to adjust quickly.
   - ATC might say: "Disregard previous instructions. You're now cleared for Runway 36L."

6. **Go-Around Procedures**: Be ready to execute a go-around at any point. Know the procedure cold.
   - Common instruction: "Unable landing clearance, go around. Fly runway heading, climb to 1,800 feet."

7. **Colored Dots**: Land on the colored dot as instructed. Don't focus solely on the runway threshold.
   - Listen carefully for: "Land on the orange/green dot" and confirm you've identified the correct dot.

8. **Immediate Compliance**: When given an instruction, comply immediately unless it would jeopardize safety.
   - ATC expects quick action: "Turn right NOW and follow the road."

9. **Spacing**: Maintain proper spacing between aircraft. If instructed to move closer or increase separation, do so promptly.
   - Watch for: "You're too close/far from the aircraft ahead. Adjust your spacing now."

10. **Runway Incursions**: After landing, exit the runway quickly and watch for other landing traffic.
    - Common reminder: "Exit the runway as soon as practical. Be alert for aircraft landing behind you."

11. **Weather Changes**: Be prepared for rapid weather changes that may alter the approach procedure.
    - Listen for: "Attention all aircraft, we're switching to the south flow due to wind shift."

12. **Avoid Distractions**: Stay focused on flying and listening to ATC. This is not the time for sight-seeing or non-essential cockpit tasks.
    - ATC may warn: "All pilots, heads up and eyes outside. High-density traffic in all quadrants."

13. **Expect the Unexpected**: The Oshkosh AirVenture environment is unique. Be prepared for non-standard instructions and situations.
    - You might hear: "Blue Cessna, orbit right over the quarry and await further instructions."

Remember, the Oshkosh Fisk Approach requires heightened situational awareness and precise flying. When in doubt, ask for clarification if workload and radio congestion permit. Safety is the top priority.
